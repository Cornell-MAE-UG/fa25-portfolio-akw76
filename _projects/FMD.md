Here is a link to a fluid mechanical dissection that I did on a Dirt Devil Vacuum. I worked with four of my classmates. <br><br>

I contributed to physically dissecting the vacuum, taking note of parts and their functions. I chose equations and assumptions to use for our calculations. I created the slideshow for our presentation, including annotating pictures for clarity. I also worked to write the script for our presentation, correctly incorporating as much MAE 3230 terms and vocabulary as possible <br>
