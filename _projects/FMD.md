Here is a link to a fluid mechanical dissection that I did on a Dirt Devil Vacuum. I worked with four of my classmates. The project was to take apart the vacuum, figure out how it worked, and apply fluid mechanics concepts, equations, and strategies we learned throughout the semester to explaining how it worked at a high level. <br>

I contributed to physically dissecting the vacuum, taking note of parts and their functions. I chose equations and assumptions to use for our calculations. I created the slideshow for our presentation, including annotating pictures for clarity. I also worked to write the script for our presentation, correctly incorporating as much MAE 3230 terms and vocabulary as possible <br>
