Here is a link to a fluid mechanical dissection that I did on a Dirt Devil Vacuum. I worked with four of my classmates. <br>

I contributed to: <br>
-Physically dissecting the vacuum, taking note of parts and their functions <br>
-Choosing equations and assumptions to use for our calculations <br>
-Creating the slideshow for our presentation, including annotating pictures for clarity <br>
-Writing the script for our presentation, correctly incorporating as much MAE 3230 terms and vocabulary as possible <br>
