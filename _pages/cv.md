#### Objective
I am an aspiring Mechanical Engineer with a strong foundation in mechanical design and eager to apply my knowledge in real-world applications.

---

#### Education
- **Cornell University**  
  *Bachelor of Science in Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering*  
  GPA: 3.8/4.0 | Graduation: May 2027

---

#### Skills
- **Software:** SolidWorks, Autodesk Fusion 360, ANSYS (FEA/CFD/AQWA), Simulink
- **Programming:** Python, MATLAB, Java
- **Tools:** 3D Printing, Laser Cutting, Dremel, Mill, Lathe

#### Projects
- **Custom GoPro Gimbal:** 
  I made a gimbal to be mounted on the bottom of a UAS. The gimbal uses an IMU to keep the GoPro pointed at the ground.   
  - Designed and fabricated GoPro gimbal (100° roll/pitch) achieving 60% weight and 55% torque reduction vs. prior model
  - Modeled full assembly in SolidWorks; selected servos, bearings, and dowel pins for strength and manufacturability
  - Integrated gimbal hardware with aircraft avionics; collaborated with electrical and imaging teams on interface design
  - Manufactured and tested 4+ gimbal prototypes using 3D-printed and ordered parts, resolving issues related to GoPro fit, bearing motion, part connections, center of gravity of rotating parts, and space constraints within the aircraft


- **High Pressure Pretreatment Setup Design:** 
  I designed and built an experimental setup to test high pressure pretreatment of saltwater for desalination.   
  - Designed and validated mounts for a 94-lb pressure vessel and 25-lb water pump using Fusion 360 and FEA
  - Assembled full hydraulic testing system (6 valves, 9 sensors, 40+ fittings)


  - **Hybrid Wind-Wave System Modeling:**
    I analyzed architectures for combined wind turbine + wave-energy converter systems
    - Simulated hybrid wind-wave energy converter dynamics using MATLAB, Wec-Sim, and ANSYS AQWA
    - Modeled hydrodynamic bodies on CAD and evaluated stability and power capture efficiency of various architectures
    - Built Simulink models of each configuration; wrote scripts in MATLAB to analyze their performance
