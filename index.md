## About Me


![Profile Picture]({{ "assets/images/Alex Weng Headshot.jpg" | relative_url }}){: class="profile-image"}

 
Hi, my name is Alex Weng! I am currently a Junior at Cornell University studying Mechanical Engineering. When I am not working, I spend most of my free time cycling and playing soccer with friends.

I am deeply passionate about mechanical design and its ability to shape the future. I believe that developing products through CAD and engineering design is the first and most essential step for advancing technology and improving lives. To me, this process offers the perfect balance between creativity and engineering expertise. I can imagine cutting-edge solutions but still apply proven technical principles to bring them to life. Whether it be in the field of aerospace, clean energy, or some other industry, I hope to use mechanical design to push the boundaries of innovation.

I’ve put together this portfolio to show you some of my projects!
